# DSA-Sorting

This is a sorting algorithm <i>Data Structures and Algorithms</i> Project 2.

The aim of this project was to develop a single sorting algorithm that would sort four different linked lists the fastest. 
Each node of the linked lists contained a last name, first name, and social security number (Each ssn was guaranteed to be 
unique). The four linked lists the program was graded on were not given before submission, but were described as:<br><br>1) 
"Approximately (within 1 percent of) 100,000 data objects. Each data object will store a randomly selected last name, a 
randomly selected first name, and a randomly generated social security number."<br>2) "Approximately (within 1 percent of) 
1,000,000 data objects. Each data object will store a randomly selected last name, a randomly selected first name, and a 
randomly generated social security number."<br>3) "The same data objects as #2, but they have already been sorted according 
to last names and first names (but not according to social security numbers)."<br>4) "Approximately (within 1 percent of) 
1,000,000 data objects. Each data object will store the same last name and the same first name (both selected randomly, 
but only once), and a randomly generated social security number."
